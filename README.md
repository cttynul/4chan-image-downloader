# * chan image downloader üçù
This is just a stupid py script to download every pic a thread given.
It works with API even without using regex despite we are not in 2005 anymore.

## Usage
`python chandownloader.py -u|--url <thread_url> [-a|--api <default=y|nope>]

-u --url here *chan thread url

-a --api nullable param, if None or "y" it will use official *chan API, if "nope" it will scrape webpage`
